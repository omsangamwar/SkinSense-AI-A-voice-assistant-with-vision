# SkinSense AI — A voice-assistant-with-vision.

An AI-powered, voice-to-voice skin consultation assistant. A patient speaks a description of their concern and uploads a skin **image or video**; the app transcribes the voice, analyzes the visual, generates a doctor-style response, and speaks that response back — a full voice-in / voice-out loop, not just text

## Overview

Traditional "upload a photo, get an AI opinion" skin-check tools stop at text. This project closes the loop: the patient **talks**, the assistant **sees and listens**, and the assistant **talks back** — like a real consultation, minus the ability to touch or examine physically (hence the disclaimer).

The app is built around four cooperating phases (see the architecture diagram below), each of which can be swapped for a different provider without touching the others:

1. **Capture** — record the patient's voice and accept an image or video upload (Gradio UI).
2. **Understand the voice** — transcribe the patient's spoken concern into text (Speech-to-Text).
3. **Understand the skin** — send the transcribed query + the image/video frame to a vision-capable LLM and get back a doctor-style response (Vision + LLM).
4. **Speak back** — convert that response into natural speech and play it to the patient (Text-to-Speech).

## Features

- 🎙️ **Voice-to-voice consultation** — speak your concern, hear the answer back, not just read it.
- 🖼️ **Image + 🎥 video input** — upload a photo for direct analysis, or a short video (a representative frame is extracted and analyzed alongside the transcript).
- 🧠 **Vision-grounded LLM reasoning** — the model reasons over both what it sees and what the patient said, not just a generic text prompt.
- 🔌 **Pluggable AI providers** — Groq, ElevenLabs, and Deepgram are all supported for STT/TTS; swap providers via environment variables without changing app logic.
- 🌐 **Simple Gradio web UI** — no separate frontend to build or deploy; runs locally with one command.
- 🔒 **Privacy-conscious by design** — no data persistence beyond the session by default; see [Security & Privacy](#security--privacy).

## Technical Architecture

![Technical architecture diagram showing four phases: patient voice and image capture, speech-to-text, vision model and LLM response, and text-to-speech](docs/architecture.svg)

### Phase 1 — Vision Model & LLM Response
The uploaded image (or an extracted video frame) is sent — together with the transcribed patient query — to a **vision-capable LLM (Groq)**. The model returns a structured, doctor-style written response: possible explanations, general care guidance, and red flags that warrant seeing a real clinician.

### Phase 2 — Text-to-Speech (TTS)
The LLM's written response is converted into a spoken audio file using **Deepgram** or **ElevenLabs** text-to-speech, so the patient receives an actual spoken reply instead of only reading text.

### Phase 3 — Speech-to-Text (STT)
The patient's recorded voice note is transcribed into text using **Groq Whisper** or **ElevenLabs** speech-to-text, producing the "transcribed text / user query" that feeds Phase 1.

### Phase 4 — Gradio Web Interface
The patient-facing layer: a microphone recorder, an image/video upload control, and playback of the generated doctor audio response — all wired together in a single Gradio app.
